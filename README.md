# andersScoreboard
Code for anders

Start up a c++ compiler such as visual studio 2019 and open andersScoreboard.vcxproj
From here under Source Files there is a file called andersScoreboard.cpp
Open andersScoreboard.proj, then use Build Solution and then use Start Without debugging

Now the command window should have opened with a scoreboard visable.
You will be asked if you want to add a new score, press 1 and then press enter
Now enter a score between 0 to 999(or a little bit more if you are feeling brave) and press enter
Now write your name or alias and press enter
Ta da! Your score and name should be in the scoreboard if your score was good enough to be among the top ten.
Now you can either repeat the previous steps to add more scores to the score board
Or you can press 2 and enter to quit.
